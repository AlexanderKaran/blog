Intercepting Errors and returning a new error with a more end-user-friendly message is a staple of JavaScript. However, this can cause us to lose steps in the stack trace or make debugging harder. Now thanks to `Error.prototype.cause` we can provide a more user-friendly message and keep a reference to the original error.

If you had a function connecting to a database or creating a table or document, you might have something like the code below. Wrapping the code in a try-catch, you might intercept the error to provide a more readable message to the API.

```javascript
const db = {
    create: (user) => user
}

try {
  const user = {name: "Alexander", email: "some@email.com"}
  db.create(user)
} catch (err) {
  // Normally you would do something with the original error here, like add to a logger or bug tracker
  throw new Error("Could not add the new user",)
}
```

We can update this catch clause to use the new `cause` property in the error to keep track of the original error.

```javascript
const db = {
    create: (user) => user
}

try {
  const user = {name: "Alexander", email: "some@email.com"}
  db.create(user)
} catch (err) {
  // Normally you would do something with the original error here, like add to a logger or bug tracker.\
  throw new Error("Could not add the new user", {cause: err})
}
```

Using the simple cause property, we have created a better error trail. All major browsers support the cause property, so you can use it today. Check the [browser compatibility list](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_error_cause) for more info.
