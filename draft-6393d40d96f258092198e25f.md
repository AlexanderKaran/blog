JavaScript is a fun language with lots of little quirks that make me love and hate it. Recently while doing a course, I found myself going over the basics again and picking up a few things I had forgotten. Let's open the hood up and look at the base primitives that make JavaScript what it is.

## JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript is a loosely typed programming language, which means you can declare a variable without defining it. For example:

```javascript
let myVariable;

// Now the variable is a Number
myVariable = 1;

// Now the variable is a String
myVariable = "hello world";
```

A loosely typed language is the opposite of a strongly typed language, such as Rust or C. In the above example, I changed the variable from a Number to a String; if I did this in Rust, it would throw an error.

JavaScript has seven primitive types. Everything else not included in the list below, including functions and arrays, is an object.

* String
    
* Number
    
* BigInt
    
* Boolean
    
* Null
    
* Undefined
    
* Symbol
    

#### Strings

A String in JavaScript can be created in multiple ways. For example:

```javascript
const stringWithSingleQuotes = 'A valid String';

const stringWithDoubleQuotes = "Also a valid string";

const stringWithBackTicks = `Also valid`;
```

Strings made with backticks ` `` ` are called 'template' strings. Template strings can be multiline and support interpolation, which allows you to pass variables into Strings.

#### Numbers and BigInt

A Number in JavaScript allows both integers (whole numbers) and decimals. Its type is a double-precision floating-point format. What does that mean, I hear you ask? A floating-point number format occupies a fixed amount of memory, usually 64 bits. If you are coming from other programming languages, you might be used to Int and Float being two different types. In JavaScript, we bundle Int and Float into one. A number does have an integer range or limit, which is where BigInt comes in, as it has no upper or lower limits.

```javascript
const wholeNumber = 1;

const floatNumber = 2.2;

// A NaN is a number that is not valid, short for Not A Number
const alsoANumber = NaN;

const bigInt = 1234n;
```

#### Boolean

Booleans are a simple type to understand either `true` or `false`.

#### Null and Undefined

Null and Undefined sometimes get used interchangeably in JavaScript, but they do have some soft rules about how they should be used. However, with JavaScript being the lawless playground it is, they are more guidelines than rules.

We usually use null to represent the absence of an object. For example, if you had a function that returns a User from the database, it should return null if it could not find the user. Undefined, on the other hand, is the absence of a defined value, for example, accessing a value in an object that does not exist or creating a variable and not assigning a value.

```javascript
const getUserFromDB = () => {
    return null;
};

// Type is null
const user = getUserFromDB();

// Type is undefined as we have not assigned a value
let fruit;

fruits = {
    apples: 5,
    bananas: 2
};

// Type is undefined as pears does not exist in the fruits object
fruits.pears
```

#### Symbol

A Symbol is often used as a unique identifier key in objects. Every time you create a Symbol, it is guaranteed to be unique. Symbols are immutable, meaning they can not be changed.

```javascript
// When creating a Symbol you can also pass a description
const symbol1 = Symbol("test");
const symbol2 = Symbol("test");

// Even if the description is the same each Symbol with be the same
symbol1 === symbol2 // Will equal false
```

#### Objects

Everything outside of the types listed above are objects in JavaScript. Objects are a set of key-value pairs. Each value can be one of the seven primitives listed above or an object. Remember, functions and arrays are also objects, meaning they can be used as values inside the object. Keys in objects are referred to as properties.

```javascript
const object1 = {
    key1: "Some string",
    key2: 123
};

// We can also nest objects inside objects
const object2 = {
    nested: {
        key1: "Some string",
        key2: 123
    },
    anArray: [1, 2, 3]
};
```

## Functions

In JavaScript, functions are an object that can be used like any other value. When a programing language can treat functions as values, for example, pass them as arguments into different functions, we say the functions are First Class Citizens. Functions can be created in a few different ways:

```javascript
// Normal function
function doSomething () {
    return 1 + 1;
};

// Arrow function
const doSomethingElse = () => {
    return 2 + 2;
};
```

One of the key differences between a normal function and an arrow function is how they treat `this`. In a normal function when `this` is accessed, it refers to the object on which the function was called, for example:

```javascript
function printName () {
  console.log(this.name)
}

const object1 = {
  name: "Object One",
  printOutName: printName
}

const object2 = {
  name: "Object Two",
  printOutName: printName
}

// This will print out Object One
object1.printOutName()

// This will print out Object Two
object2.printOutName()
```

Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context, so when you call `this` in an arrow function, it refers to the `this` of the nearest parent that is not an arrow function.

```javascript
const object1 = {
  name: "Object One",
  printOutName: () => {
    console.log(this.name)
  }
};

// This will not print out name as the arrow function does not have a this nor a parent function to reference
object1.printOutName();

// If we re-write the arrow function to be called inside a normal function we can grab the this reference
function printName () {
  const arrowFunction = () => {
    console.log(this.name)
  }
  arrowFunction()
}

const object2 = {
  name: "Object Two",
  printOutName: printName
};

object2.printOutName()
```

Another critical difference between the arrow and the normal functions is the prototype property; arrow functions do not have access to the prototype.

## Prototypes

Every time you create a function, a prototype is created. Remember, functions are objects. So when we say create function, we are saying create an object. Prototypes are JavaScript's way of inheriting properties from one thing to another.

We are going to use the `Object.create` function, a static function that gives a little more control over the object creation process. You can read more in the MDN Docs if you have not used it before.

Let's look at an example using functions, sometimes referred to as function inheritance.

```javascript
const car = {
  drive: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name} is driving`)
  }
}

// Here we create an petrol car using Object.create
// Passing in our car object means the drive function is passed down to the petrolCar object
const petrolCar = Object.create(car, {
  fillTank: {value: function () {
    console.log(`Filling ${this.name} petrol tank`)
  }}
})

// Here we create an electric car using Object.create
const electricCar = Object.create(car, {
  chargeCar: {value: function () {
    console.log(`Charging ${this.name} battery`)
  }}
})

// The honda is created using the petrolCar meaning it inherits the functions drive and fillTank
const honda = Object.create(petrolCar, {
  name: {value: "Honda"}
})

// The tesla is created using the electricCar meaning it inherits the functions drive and chargeCar
const tesla = Object.create(electricCar, {
  name: {value: "Tesla"}
})

// Prints out 'Honda is driving'
honda.drive()
// Prints out 'Filling Honda petrol tank'
honda.fillTank()
// TypeError: honda.chargeCar is not a function 
honda.chargeCar()


// Prints out 'Tesla is driving'
tesla.drive()
// TypeError: tesla.fillTank is not a function
tesla.fillTank()
// Prints out 'Charging Tesla battery'
tesla.chargeCar()
```

Let's go over what happens when calling the functions on `honda` and `tesla`.

* When the `honda` calls `drive()`, it checks for the `drive` property that it does not have.
    
* Next, the JS runtime checks if the `honda` prototype which is `petrolCar` has the `drive` property, which it does not.
    
* Then the runtime checks to see if the prototype of `petrolCar` has the `drive` property. The prototype for `petrolCar` is `car`, which does have the `drive` property, so `drive` is called.
    

The `drive` function uses `this.name` to print out the name. When it is called by `honda`, the name from the `honda` object is used.

When `honda` calls `chargeCar` or `tesla` calls `fillTank`, we get a type error as they never inherited those functions through the prototype chain.

## Classes

For those familiar with object-oriented programming, you might think this seems a very convoluted way to do inheritance, and we should use classes instead. Classes in JS are like sugar syntax on top of prototypes. JavaScript did not get classes till 2015, and they do not function like classes in other languages. Let's rebuild our example from before but with classes to see how they work.

```javascript
class Car {
  // Here we create the name field
  name
  
  // Next we create a constructor so the name field is populated on the creation of a new instance of the class
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }
  
  // Then we create the public method called drive
  drive() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is driving`)
  }
}

// Next we create a new class that extends Car meaning it will inherit its methods and fields
class PetrolCar extends Car {
  constructor(name) {
    // We call super here to pass the constructor down to the car class
    super(name)
  }
  
  fillTank() {
    console.log(`Filling ${this.name} petrol tank`)
  }
}

class ElectricCar extends Car {
  constructor(name) {
    super(name)
  }
  
  chargeCar() {
   console.log(`Charging ${this.name} battery`)
  }
}


// The honda is created using the Petrol Car Class meaning it gets the fields and methods from Car and PetrolCar
const honda = new PetrolCar("Honda")

// The tesla is created using the Electric Car Class meaning it get the fields and methods from Car and Electric Car
const tesla = new ElectricCar("Tesla")

// Prints out 'Honda is driving'
honda.drive()
// Prints out 'Filling Honda petrol tank'
honda.fillTank()
// Propertv 'chargeCar' does not exist on †vne 'PetrolCar'
honda.chargeCar()


// Prints out 'Tesla is driving'
tesla.drive()
// TypeError: tesla.fillTank is not a function
tesla.fillTank()
// Prints out 'Charging Tesla battery'
tesla.chargeCar()
```

The class example does seem like a cleaner and easier-to-read method for inheritance and object-oriented programing. Since their introduction in 2015, they have become a preferred method for creating objects and using inheritance.

## Next Steps

Now you have the basics of JavaScript down. I would highly recommend digging deeper into some of the new features in JS that have been added over the last five years. We added optional and optional chaining, making things much easier for working will nested null values. One of the most used features I use daily is [destructing assignments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) which were only added in 2015.

JavaScript is a funny language. It can be used to build almost anything and does almost anything, but it is not without its quirks. For example, `NaN` which is an invalid number does not equal the type of number. Depending on your point of view, there are so many fun or annoying quirks in JavaScript, but they only make me love it more.
